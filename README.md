# Mutual_Friend_Analysis_using_Hadoop_MapReduce
This project takes a list of people and their friends list as dataset input.The map stage sorts out the friends of two persons at an instance using the principle of one to many in alphabetical order. In the map output, the two friends are taken as a key and their mutual friends are retrieved as a value pair and sorting is performed.The output is displayed as an adjacency matrix or the list of friends and their mutual friends in key-value pairs. The project is executed on Cloudera. The best friendship recommendations often come from friends. The key idea is that if two people have a lot of mutual friends, but they are not friends, then the system should recommend them to be connected to each other. Letâ€™s assume that the friendships are undirected: if A is a friend of B then B is also a friend of A. This is the most common friendship system used in Facebook, Google+, Linkedin, and several social networks.
